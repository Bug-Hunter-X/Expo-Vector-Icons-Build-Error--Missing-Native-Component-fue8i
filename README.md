# Expo Vector Icons Build Error: Missing Native Component

This repository demonstrates a common build error encountered when using the `@expo/vector-icons` package in Expo projects. The error typically manifests during the build process, particularly for Android, due to problems linking the necessary font files.  This example shows the error and how to resolve it.

**Problem:** Vague error messages related to missing native components or `requireNativeComponent` failures.

**Solution:** Ensuring proper linking and configuration of the font files used by the `@expo/vector-icons` package.  This often involves checking the Expo configuration, build process, and potentially manual linking of resources.
