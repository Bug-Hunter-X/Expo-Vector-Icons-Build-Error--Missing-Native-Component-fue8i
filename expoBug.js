This error typically occurs when you're using Expo's `@expo/vector-icons` package and haven't correctly configured the necessary font files.  The error message might be vague, sometimes indicating an issue with the `requireNativeComponent` function, failing to find a native component, or similar issues related to missing or improperly linked resources.  This often arises when building for Android, but can also affect iOS builds.  The root cause is usually a problem with the linking of font assets during the build process.
